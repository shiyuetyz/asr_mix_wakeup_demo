I was coming downstairs to have breakfast when the post came.
I was  waiting for a letter from my friend Sam,
so I picked the letters up and looked  through them.
I wasn't surprised to see that there were some bills.
There was an invitation to a party.
There wasn't a letter from Sam.
There was a postcard, showing some beaches and the sea.
What a nice view!
I turned the postcard over.
It wasn't easy to read.
The rain had made the writing unclear,including the name of the person who had sent the postcard.
Who was it from?
I tried to read any of the words.
I could read "Dear Tom, I'm having a lovely time in ...",
Then the writing became unclear.
I couldn't read anything else.
Who had gone to the seaside? 
I couldn't think of anyone! 
It was a mystery.
There was another mystery too.
Where was Sam's letter? 
Just then the phone rang.
It was Sam!
"I'm calling to see if you got my postcard",he said.
We are at the seaside, not in London.
We changed our  minds.
Mum and Dad are resting after taking a walk.
So I'm ringing you.
I'm sorry I didn't write a letter.
I've been so busy!
Both mysteries were solved!
